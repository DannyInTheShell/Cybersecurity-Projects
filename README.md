Personal &amp; Educational Security Projects

## Welcome to My Cybersecurity Project Portfolio  

Thank you for visiting my repository! This collection of projects showcases the cybersecurity skills Iâ€™ve developed through hands-on experience and dedicated learning. Itâ€™s all about demonstrating my practical expertise and passion for tackling real-world security challenges.  

With over two decades of work experience and a commitment to continuous learningâ€”including my pursuit of a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Cybersecurity (expected completion Winter 2025)â€”Iâ€™ve built a solid foundation in securing systems, troubleshooting issues, and solving problems creatively. Every day, I strive to sharpen my skills and adapt to the fast-paced and ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.  

## Why This Portfolio?  
The goal is to provide a glimpse into my practical skills and illustrate why Iâ€™d be a valuable addition to any security team. From conducting security audits to scripting automation and securing networks, each project is designed to highlight my technical abilities and dedication to staying ahead in this dynamic field.  

## Explore & Connect  
Feel free to take a look around! I encourage you to explore the projects and see what Iâ€™ve been working on. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential opportunities, Iâ€™d love to connect with you.

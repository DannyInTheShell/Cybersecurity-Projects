# **Internal Audit Scenario: Botium Toys** 

This scenario is based on a fictional company:  

**Botium Toys** is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The company operates from a single physical location that functions as their main office, a storefront, and a warehouse for their products. Over time, **Botium Toys’** online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and internationally. This expansion has increased the pressure on their Information Technology (IT) department to support a global online market.  

The IT department manager has decided to conduct an internal IT audit to address growing concerns. She is focused on maintaining compliance and ensuring the company can sustain business operations as it scales, despite lacking a clear plan. The internal audit aims to secure the company’s infrastructure, identify and mitigate potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to critical assets, and ensure compliance with regulations. 

Particular attention is being paid to regulations regarding:  
- Internally processing and accepting online payments.  
- Conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).  

To address these challenges, the IT manager has implemented the **National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF)** and taken the following steps:  
1. **Defined Audit Scope and Goals:** Established clear objectives for the internal audit.  
2. **Listed Managed Assets:** Documented assets currently overseen by the IT department.  
3. **Completed a Risk Assessment:** Evaluated risks and potential vulnerabilities in the current security posture.  

### Objective of the Audit  
The primary goal is to provide an overview of the risks and potential fines the company may face due to its current security posture.  

The results of this audit will help Botium Toys strengthen their security posture and ensure compliance with applicable regulations as the company continues to grow.  


# Botium Toys: Scope, Goals, and Risk Assessment Report

## Scope and Goals of the Audit

### Scope
The scope is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This means all assets need to be assessed alongside internal processes and procedures related to the implementation of controls and compliance best practices.

### Goals
Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to determine which controls and compliance best practices need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys’ security posture.

## Current Assets
Assets managed by the IT Department include: 
- **On-premises equipment** for in-office business needs.  
- **Employee equipment**: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.
- **Storefront products** available for retail sale on-site and online; stored in the company’s adjoining warehouse.
- **Management of systems, software, and services**: accounting, telecommunication, database, security, e-commerce, and inventory management.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description
Currently, there is inadequate management of assets. Additionally, Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully compliant with U.S. and international regulations and standards. 

### Control Best Practices
The first of the five functions of the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** is *Identify*. Botium Toys will need to:
- Dedicate resources to identify assets for appropriate management.
- Classify existing assets and determine the impact of their loss on business continuity.

### Risk Score
On a scale of 1 to 10, the risk score is **8**, which is fairly high due to a lack of controls and adherence to compliance best practices.

---

## Additional Comments
The potential impact from the loss of an asset is rated as **medium**, because the IT department does not know which assets would be at risk. The risk to assets or fines from governing bodies is rated as **high** because Botium Toys does not have all necessary controls in place or fully adhere to compliance regulations to keep critical data private and secure. Below are specific details:

### Identified Issues:
- **Employee access**: All employees currently have access to internally stored data, including cardholder data and customers' PII/SPII.
- **Encryption**: Customers' credit card information is not encrypted during acceptance, processing, transmission, or storage.
- **Access controls**: Least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
- **Data integrity and availability**: The IT department has ensured data integrity and implemented controls for availability.
- **Firewall**: A firewall is in place, blocking traffic based on defined security rules.
- **Antivirus software**: Installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.
- **Lack of IDS**: No intrusion detection system (IDS) is installed.
- **Disaster recovery**: No disaster recovery plans or backups of critical data exist.
- **E.U. compliance**: A plan to notify E.U. customers within 72 hours of a breach is in place, and privacy policies are enforced internally.
- **Password policy**:
  - Requirements are nominal and not aligned with current best practices (e.g., minimum length, complexity).
  - No centralized password management system is in place, leading to productivity issues with password recovery.
- **Legacy systems**: Monitored and maintained, but there is no regular schedule or clear intervention methods.
- **Physical security**: The physical location has sufficient locks, up-to-date CCTV surveillance, and functioning fire detection/prevention systems.

By addressing these issues, Botium Toys can significantly enhance its security posture and reduce risks to its assets, data, and compliance efforts.
